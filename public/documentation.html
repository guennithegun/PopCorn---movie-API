  <h1>PopCorn</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    PopCorn is a movie web application. It will provide users with acces to information about different movies, directors and genres. The users are able to sign up, update personal information and create a list of their favorite movie.
    <br>
    For that purpose I create a backend environment that stores movie data in a database and provides acces to that data via a REST API. This API reads requests from the client, apllies the appropriate operation to the resource being requested and send back a response that indicates whether or not the request was sucessfully fulfilled.
    <br>
    This functionality is what will allow the users to access information about the different movies, directors and genres stored in the database.
    <br>
    On serverside the web app will showcase a well-designed API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
